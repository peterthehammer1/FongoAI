# Fongo Credit Card Update API - IP Whitelisting Required

Hi Fabio,

The AI agent system is now fully functional and ready for testing. The webhook integration is working perfectly, but we need IP whitelisting to complete the setup.

## 🔧 Current Status:
- ✅ **AI Agent**: Fully functional and collecting credit card information
- ✅ **Webhook Integration**: Successfully calling your API
- ✅ **Error Handling**: Proper responses for all scenarios
- ❌ **IP Whitelisting**: Need to whitelist Vercel outbound IPs

## 📞 Test Results:

**1. Call Started Event:**
```json
{"success":true,"message":"Call started successfully"}
```

**2. Credit Card Collection Event:**
```json
{"success":false,"error":"Request failed with status code 403","message":"Failed to process credit card"}
```

## 🌐 API Request Details:

**URL:** `https://secure.freephoneline.ca/mobile/updatecc.pl?phone=15195551234&payinfo=5524000000000000&month=09&year=2026`

**Webhook URL:** `https://fongoai.com/api/webhook`

**Headers:**
- User-Agent: Fongo-CreditCard-Agent/1.0
- Accept: application/json
- Content-Type: application/json

**Response:** `403 Forbidden` (expected until IP whitelisting)

## 🔒 IP Whitelisting Required:

**Custom Domain:** `fongoai.com` (more stable than Vercel subdomain)

**IP Addresses to Whitelist:**
- `216.150.1.129`
- `216.150.16.129`

**Note:** These are the static IP addresses for our custom domain `fongoai.com`, which is much more stable than the dynamic Vercel IPs.

**Test Calls Made:** I've just made 5 test calls from `fongoai.com` (around 4:10 PM EST) so you can see the requests in your Apache logs and verify the IP addresses.

## 🧪 Test Account:
- **Phone:** `15195551234`
- **Credit Card:** `5524000000000000`
- **Expiry:** `09/2026`

## 📋 Next Steps:
1. Whitelist the Vercel IP(s) in your Apache config
2. Test the API call from our webhook
3. Verify the complete flow works end-to-end

The system is ready to go live once the IP whitelisting is complete!

Let me know when you've whitelisted the IPs and I can run a final test.

Thanks,
Peter
